# Project Pitches

This repository will hold project slides used to pitch your project idea in class on Thursday, October 16.

In the `slides` folder, add a *single* pdf or image file to be used as a slide named after the presenter's UW NetID.

In the `descriptions` folder, add a single text file with the same name (UW NetID) with the following information:

```
Presenter: Name
Names of other teammates

Project nickname

Dataset #1 intended; access to and experience with data
Dataset #2 intended; access to and experience with data

Any additional information you'd like to share.
```

I may submit a slide with whatever content that supports my pitch, named `bernease.pdf` or `bernease.jpg` or `bernease.png`.

For example, I should save a single file with the same name `bernease.txt` in `descriptions` folder. Contents would look like this:

```
Presenter: Bernease Herman
Collin Lockhard
Joe Hellerstein
David Beck

Project: Commits when live events are occurring

Dataset #1: GitHub commit history from GitHub public API;
quite familiar with this data, data in-hand
Dataset #2: SeatGeek live events REST API
(https://seatgeek.com/build); not terribly familiar with
this data, but checked Terms of Service and API seems easy
enough

This project doesn't exist because it's an example to
demonstrate use of this repository. I hope to explore
whether or not more commits are made when there are more
events going on in Seattle. We are able to filter GitHub
users by the locations they note on their profiles, so
will use that.
